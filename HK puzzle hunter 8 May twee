But looking back on her short life of 40 years, her courage and perseverance made her a great success in both her singing and acting career.

(bg:(hsl:210,0.8039,0.5,0.55))[Considering the context of the times, Anita Mui's road to fame is the same as the lifeblood of the era in Hong Kong. In the 1970s, when she was growing up, the external environment caused the colonial government to change its policies. Hong Kong's civic class developed rapidly, local culture became prominent, and Cantonese songs became popular. She worked her way up from the grassroots to the grassroots and was a righteous and resilient person. From the grassroots to the elite, she matched the inner culture of Hong Kong's urban development, and this "spirit of the Lion's Rock" has made her a popularly recognized "Daughter of Hong Kong".

(bg:(hsl:49,1,0.8745,0.25))[Li: Zing/Jing mainly plays male characters who have outstanding characteristics in terms of character, quality or appearance. Character, quality, or appearance are expressed through specific facial features. That is to say, they are adjusted according to the character's personality. Red face mostly shows loyalty and justice. Black faces mostly show integrity, bravery or recklessness. Blue faces mostly show bravery and tenacity.

(bg:(hsl:49,1,0.8745,0.25))[Li: The name "Cau/Chou" is derived from the fact that Jokers often put on a small amount of white powder when applying make-up to disguise themselves as 'ugly'. The word "clown" refers more to the unattractiveness of the character than to the ugliness of the character. The roles they played included both sinister and cunning characters, as well as upright and kind-hearted figures.

[Li: However, the Sunbeam Theatre still experienced many troubles. 2012, the then owner of the theater was unable to pay the deposit because of the high rent. At this critical juncture, I thought twice and on the eve of the closing, I directly reached a cooperation with the landlord so that the theater could reopen.

Li: In the present day, the influence of Cantonese opera has long since lost its prosperity in the 1900s. I hope that more young people will have a greater passion for this traditional art form. I am also making efforts to this end. For example, adding digital theaters, opening theater museums in theaters, and so on. I hope to see $name again in the future!]

This school lake is located in Chung Chi College of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, sandwiched between Chung Chi Hall (Chung Chi Dining Hall) and Lingnan Stadium, formerly known as the "Lotus Pond". The name of the lake is "Uncircumcised", which implies the meaning of "not yet complete, we must continue to strive for perfection", echoing the motto of Chung Chi College, "Stop at Perfection". "The meaning connotates with the school motto, which is the spirit of self-improvement with perfection as the eternal ideal.

Meanwhile, on November 12, 2003, the 137th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, the University of Hong Kong (HKU) held an unveiling ceremony for a bronze statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen at the Lotus Pond. The bronze statue commemorates the 80th anniversary of Dr. Sun's visit to the University of Hong Kong. Professor Lung Ping-yee of the Department of Architecture, the Chairman of the Antiquities Advisory Board at that time, was responsible for the project. As the convenor of the project, he formed a working group with several professors and experts from the University. He visited various places to collect information and find a sculptor before finally choosing the work of Professor Szeto Siu-Kwong, who created the sculpture - in the form of the appearance and costume of Dr. Sun's visit to the University of Hong Kong. The sculpture is made of bronze, weighing one ton, 1.2 times the size of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life-size, and took three years from conception to completion.

HKU recognizes Dr. Sun Yat-sen as one of its most distinguished alums for his selfless dedication to his country and people. HKU has erected a memorial statue of Dr. Sun to reflect his image and encourage students to strive for excellence and contribute to society.

(bg:(hsl:210,0.8039,0.5,0.4))[A fateful trip to London in 1969. Former Dairy Farm employee Ho King Yuen saw the joyful sight of children gathered around Mister Softee and had the idea to bring Mister Softee to Hong Kong. Trucks on the streets of London yell for a cone that makes people smile.

After returning from his overseas trip, Mr Ho teamed up with two friends, Ted Drew and Tang Hok Yuen, to establish Mister Softee in Hong Kong, and the following year, the enterprising trio imported their first truck from the UK and began operations on New Year's Eve.

(bg:(hsl:210,0.8039,0.5,0.4))[Despite its Chinese name "å¯è±ªéªç³", which translates to "rich man's ice cream", Mister Softee has always been an inexpensive summer treat, and its signature soft-serve ice cream has always been a popular one. Its signature soft serve ice cream cost just $0.50 per cone when it first opened. The ice cream truck's emergence coincided with the economically optimistic social climate of the 1970s when people could barely afford small gifts. Coupled with the novelty element, Mister Softee naturally took off, selling more than 1,600 cones per hour!

This ice cream brand has become a childhood memory for generations of people in Hong Kong. But now, there are only 16 ice cream trucks left in Hong Kong. If you see one, you must try it!]

<img src=https://www.hku.hk/f/page/7546/270p333/history@750.jpg >

(text-colour:grey)+(bg:(hsl:34,1,0.951,0.7))[The Faculty of Medicine was developed from the Hong Kong Chinese College of Medicine, which was founded in 1887. The most famous alumnus of the Faculty was Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the "Father of the Nation".

In December 1916, the University held its first degree conferment ceremony, and only 23 students graduated.

Ten years after its establishment, the University of Hong Kong admitted female students for the first time.]

"In addition to the classic design of the fish stalls of the 1950s, the team has added various details, such as placing a large wooden barrel above the water tank, hanging salty grasses as wrapping, and placing "fresh fish" for customers to buy on the countertops of the stalls so that citizens can recall more memories in the experience."

]

[Chow Chun Fai was born in 1980 and lives in Hong Kong. Fai graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong with a B.A. and M.A. degree, where he currently teaches painting.  In his latest series of "Movie Paintings", Fai depicts animated transitions and matching subtitles from classic Hong Kong films of the New Wave Cinema movement as well as more recent, internationally acclaimed films. ]

[The artist captures the diversity of cinematic scenes and incorporates into his paintings the intricacies of Hong Kong's local culture, especially the social tensions that have arisen from the city's socio-political upheavals since 1997. Borrowing from a number of films that condense the collective memory of Hong Kong people, Fai reveals the struggles and anxieties that the city has experienced in response to the critical but unresolved issues of locality and identity that continue to redefine Hong Kong.

(Woman responds) I advise you to speak cautiously; a delicate flower like you should not meddle; hey, I advise you to uphold proper conduct, Quickly leave, and don't stick around.

(Man responds) I am overly enthusiastic; I Fell in love with you at first sight, my jade-like lady; I am new to courting and seeking your favour; hey, spare me your scornful looks.

(Woman, singing) Your words disgust me; Your actions are of low quality and seriousness.

(Man responds) What's considered low quality? I sincerely seek your guidance, Guanyin; your compassionate heart should respond.

(Woman responds) Guanyin wouldn't help bad people with wrong intentions.

(Man responds) Guanyin also has a compassionate heart for relieving suffering and difficulties.
(Woman responds) You beg me, your face covered in tooth marks.

(Man responds) I'm a romantic; hey, I'm not even married yet.

(Woman responds) Hey, take a good look at yourself; what kind of person are you? You look like a cat; who would marry you?

(Man responds) My famous looks are perfect for matching with a girl.

(Woman responds) Hmph, don't bother me; you're annoyingly persistent.

(Man responds) I only wish to be your true lover.

(Woman responds) You despicable person, who would want to be with you?

(Man, addressing two bald characters) You, a tall cat like you, matched with this foolish person, is most suitable.

(Woman, singing the prologue) You could be crazy, foolish, and brainless.

(Man responds) You're called seductive and coy, And you act so naive. Please don't have a bad heart; I have my prayers; why deceive people?

(Man continues) You must pray to the gods for marriage.

(Woman responds) You're a despicable and base character, Truly a wretched person; even ghosts would prefer being that than being human.

(Man responds) Even if I die and go to the underworld, My soul will follow you closely.

(Woman responds) Even if the king of Hell refuses, I won't let you off easily; I'll make you a restless spirit in the 18 layers of Hell.

(Man responds) Believe in Yama; He will have compassion for true lovers.

(Woman responds) Then you have a destiny with ghosts. Hurry up and get married underground.

(Man responds) Why are you so heartless? My intentions are sincere, True love, and making a tender commitment.

(Woman responds) You're such a bad person; Your words make people angry.

(Man responds) Heh, your anger is so beautiful; most wonderful is your coquettish charm; please have mercy on me.

(Woman responds) Seeing your body filled with resentment makes people truly angry.

Rong: I love your beauty and charm. Please forgive my hardship. Since I met you, my heart has been deeply impressed.

Lan: You annoy me every day. I dislike you very much, and you truly make me hate you. I'm furious.

Rong: You completely misunderstood. I am a scholar in this world. If you agree, marry me.

Rong: Alright, Miss.

Lan: Who will marry you? Get lost; don't think you can disrespectfully fool around. Your blabbering is chaotic. If you are smart enough, take back your heart and go to bed.

(bg:(hsl:210,0.8039,0.5,0.4))[Neon: [Bauhinia in Bloom" is a sculpture located at the Golden Bauhinia Square in front of the new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center on the Wan Chai waterfront in Hong Kong. Sculpted according to the shape of a budding Bauhinia, it weighs 7 tons and measures 6 meters in length, width and height. It is cast in bronze with Italian gold leaf and supported by a Sichuan red granite plinth. The square base of the pedestal symbolizes the squareness of the nine states, and the Great Wall pattern in the ring symbolizes that the motherland will always embrace Hong Kong. The base is engraved with the words "Bauhinia in full bloom forever" in golden letters, symbolizing Hong Kong's eternal prosperity.]
